# rod_detection
The YepparAI Rod Detection System is an AI-driven application developed using Ultralytics YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It enables real-time detection, measurement, and validation of rods, including notch identification and edge distance calculation. The project is implemented with a Streamlit-based UI, allowing for image-based and live-feed processing.
